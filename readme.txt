Testing

   Dragged the html file to an empty webpage and watched it run. It takes a randomly selected
   sample input and it is then sorted by each of the sorting algorithms.

Credits

   Code was borrowed from the js-p5-example folder provided by Professor Chuck Siska. The format of the CSS and HTML file
   was used, and most of the code provided in draw-stuff.js was left intact, with only a few edits.
